SocialGame--Thesis-
===================

Social Game / Facebook

Facebook app that combined with a flash/actionscript minigame allows us to recollect users' access tokens in order to analyze those users' Facebook data. Several experiments written in Python too like trend analysis, friends graph, sentiment analysis, tag clouds, etc.

Files:

main.py: Main python class. Controls the game. It must be run on the webserver

socketServer.py: Server socket to manage connections between the server and the users

flash_game folder: Contains the main files of the flash game the users run in their browsers after compiled.

experiments folder: Some of the experiments I made without the data I collected in Facebook

my_examples: Some of the classes I made to collect and process data from Facebook and some other small examples I made using Facebook and Twitter APIs.
